#CRUD backend server via Golang

This is the backend code for the CRUD app with Mongo db

This server can handle Create, Read, Update and Delete actions. It uses mux as handler. Also imported a cors package to handle cors . I will leave the links for these packages. 

https://github.com/gorilla/mux
https://github.com/rs/cors

Even though this code works it is not finalized. I am still working on it. 
What i will do next: 
I will make a better folder structure
I will fix repeating code.
