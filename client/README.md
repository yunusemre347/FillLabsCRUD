#This is the frontend client of CRUD App

React app with Typescript for Create, Read, Update and Delete actions

This App can send CRUD requests to server and display these actions. It is a simple array shown in a grid layout. 

This is not finalized code. I am still working on it. Here are some of the things i will be working on next but more might come:

I will make it more readable,
I will fix inline stylings so they are not as confusing as it is.
I might switch to axios instead of custom fetch. (Ä± probably will)
I cant get the useCallback work i coulnd't figure out yet. I definitely would do  that
