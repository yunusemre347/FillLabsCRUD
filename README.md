#CRUD App using React and Go

This is a full stack project to practice basic Create, Read , Update and Delete functions.

This project uses React with Typescript template as frontend client and Golang with Mongo Database as backend server.

You can find detailed information about client and server in their respective readme files.

Even though it works, this project hasnt been finalized yet.

I am working on to make it closer to best practices.
